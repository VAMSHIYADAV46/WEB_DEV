    <p>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, often freely available on the web - for example, on JavaScript.
        
        Even though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have knowledge and skills such as:
        
        Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript[2]
        Programming/coding/scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks
        Understanding server-side/client-side architecture and communication of the kind mentioned above
        Ability to utilize a database[3]</p>
